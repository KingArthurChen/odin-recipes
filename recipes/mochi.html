    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Green tea mochi is a delicious rice cake that comes from Japan. You'll definitely want to try this matcha rice cake if you have an incurable sweet tooth. It's a pretty wagashi, or traditional Japanese sweets, that's a nice light tea-time snack!</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>50 g tbsps sweet rice flour</li>
        <li>25 g sugar</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon matcha powder</li>
        <li>¼ cup cornstarch for dusting</li>
        <li>½ cup red bean paste</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a microwave-safe bowl, mix flour, sugar, and matcha powder. Add water and mix until all ingredients are dissolved. Cover the bowl loosely. Microwave for 2 minutes using the lowest setting on the temperature indicator. Take it out and fold it with a damp spatula.</li>
        <li>Cover and microwave at 30 seconds intervals until the dough becomes slightly translucent. Place baking paper on the working surface, and dust it generously with cornstarch. Next, transfer the microwave matcha-flavoured mochi dough onto baking paper. Sprinkle more cornstarch onto the dough, so it does not stick to the paper.</li>
        <li>Divide the dough into four equal parts. Flatten the dough into a circular shape using your hands. Now, scoop the red bean paste into a small ball and place it in the middle of the dough. Pinch the four corners of the dough, and push them together. Tap the bottom with cornstarch.</li>
        <li>Finally, give the green tea mochi a light brush to remove excess cornstarch. If you want, you can also sprinkle some matcha powder on the top.</li>
    </ol>
