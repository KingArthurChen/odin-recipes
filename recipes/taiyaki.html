    <h2>Description</h2>

        <li>170 grams butter (6 ounces, 12 tablespoons)</li>
        <li>65 grams light brown sugar (2.3 ounces, 8 tablespoons)</li>
        <li>100 grams egg (2 eggs, 3.5 ounces)</li>
        <li>240 grams cake flour (8.5 ounces, 1 1/2 cup)</li>
        <li>6 grams baking powder (0.2 ounces, 2 teaspoons)</li>
        <li>155 grams warm milk (5.5 ounces, 2/3 cup)</li>
        <li>10 grams honey (0.35 ounces, 2 teaspoons)</li>
        <li>6 grams light soy sauce (0.2 ounces, 2 teaspoons)</li>
        <li>4 grams vanilla extract (0.14 ounces, 2 teaspoons)</li>
        <li>3 parts sugar / 150 grams (5.3 ounces)</li>
        <li>5 parts red beans / 250 grams (8.8 ounces)</li>
        <li>10 parts water / 500 grams (17.6 ounces)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Pressure cook the adzuki beans with the water for 1 hour.</li>
        <li>Pur√©e the beans in a food processor until you achieve a fine, sandy texture. It will seem very dry, but it will be rehydrated in the next step.</li>
        <li>Return the beans to a saucepan and add just enough water until the bean paste barely starts to clump together.</li>
        <li>Cook the beans with the sugar, stirring until the paste comes together and the sugar fully dissolves into the paste, about 3 minutes.</li>
        <li>Pass the beans through a sieve to remove any chunks for a finer paste.</li>
        <li>Shape the paste into inserts that will fit inside the fish-shaped taiyaki.</li>
        <li>Cream the butter together with the sugar</li>
        <li>Beat in one egg, then the other</li>
        <li>Beat in half the flour, then the milk, then the other half of flour</li>
        <li>Use a squeeze bottle to squeeze a pool of batter into the body, then the tail, and around the body again.</li>
        <li>Place the red bean insert into the center of the taiyaki and press in halfway.</li>
        <li>Pour more batter over the red bean insert so that it's fully covered.</li>
        <li>Check the doneness of each side and if not done, continue grilling at 45-second intervals.</li>
        <li>The taiyaki are done when they are evenly golden brown. Remove with a pair of chopsticks.</li>
        <li>Serve while still warm and crunchy on the outside. Oishi!</li>
    </ol>
